# Schema enforcement

Schema enforcement is an opt-in host authorization and local-file transaction layer over Fabric. It is disabled by default for compatibility.

```json
{
  "schema": {
    "mode": "enforce",
    "certificateTtlMs": 30000,
    "maxFiles": 100,
    "maxBytes": 10485760,
    "trustedCommands": {
      "focused-tests": {
        "command": "pnpm",
        "args": ["exec", "vitest", "run", "tests/focused.test.ts"],
        "shell": false,
        "timeoutMs": 30000
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`mode` is `off`, `audit`, or `enforce`. Invalid values normalize to `off`. The certificate TTL is bounded to 1 second–10 minutes, file count to 1–1,000, and transaction bytes to 1 KiB–100 MiB. The default is `off`, 30 seconds, 100 files, and 10 MiB. Mode is fixed when the session initializes; a config reload cannot change it until the next session.

Global Fabric configuration is trusted host input. Project `.pi/fabric.json` is read only when Pi marks the project trusted. Therefore `trustedCommands` cannot be supplied through a model action or an untrusted project configuration.

## Modes

- **off** preserves existing action authorization and tool visibility. The `schema.*` control plane is available but does not gate other actions.
- **audit** allows existing behavior and publishes a durable `would_block` event to `fabric.schema` for every nested Fabric action or top-level Pi tool call enforce mode would deny.
- **enforce** permits only this extension's exact, source-provenanced `fabric_exec` definition at the top level. A `tool_call` gate blocks every other built-in, external-extension, and SDK `customTools` call before execution. Nested calls are admitted only while an owned outer invocation is active and their id begins with Fabric's generated `NESTED_TOOL_CALL_ID_PREFIX`; those calls have already passed registry authorization. The central resolved-action gate remains authoritative inside Fabric, so direct refs and computed `tools.call` refs share the same decision.

Enforce mode allows discovery and workflow display operations plus these exact host-owned actions:

- `pi.read`, `pi.grep`, `pi.find`, `pi.ls`;
- `memory.recall`, `memory.expand`, `memory.sessions`;
- `state.get`, `state.history`, `state.complexity`;
- `mesh.self`, `mesh.read`, `mesh.members`, `mesh.get`, `mesh.list`;
- `compact.status`;
- `schema.status`, `schema.hypothesize`, `schema.verify`, `schema.commit`, `schema.abort`.

It blocks `pi.edit`, `pi.write`, `pi.bash`, all agent actions across both lifecycles, mesh and state writes or execution, `compact.request` and `compact.cancel`, MCP, captured extensions, and every external provider regardless of its declared risk. A provider claiming `risk: "read"` does not bypass this exact-reference policy. Guard failures are recorded in the existing typed execution trace with `failureStage: "guard"`.

Persistent agents are not restored and host-event dispatch is disabled for an enforce session. Agent execution is disabled and agent actions are blocked. Capture `keepVisible`, descriptor risk, claimed source metadata, or tool visibility cannot authorize a second top-level path. A colliding external or SDK tool named `fabric_exec` is blocked unless Pi's canonical `sourceInfo.path` identifies this extension entry exactly.

## Planning authority

Schema is the progression authority for nontrivial Fabric work. Every non-trivial prewalk checklist requires a typed Schema-first contract; the checklist is a readable rendering of that contract, not an independent source of truth. The contract carries intent, reference questions with evidence refs, local scope (files, symbols, cascade refs), invariants, and postconditions. The contract is parsed strictly: missing, incomplete, empty-scope, or unverified reference contracts are rejected at planning time. Trivial dispositions (one or two small edits) remain schema-free. Schema governs progression; codemap and CGC remain the evidence retrieval sources that answer reference questions, and Schema does not replace them.

Graphs are evidence, not progression:

- **CGC** answers reference questions. When the request names CGC, a repository, or a comparison, planning queries each named reference with `codemap({ operation: "explore", mode: "cgc", context: "<repo>" })` and reports unavailable or unregistered contexts explicitly. Selected ideas are source-verified against the reference checkout before adoption.
- **Local Codemap** (`mode: "ast"`) maps project scope before planning with `search`, `refs`, and `cascade`, and validates structure after commit: rerun `refs` and `cascade` on every changed signature or symbol and confirm no out-of-scope file changed.

Adoption is staged. The mandatory typed contract and planning guidance are live; global `schema.mode` remains `off`, so direct tool behavior is unchanged. Promotion to `audit` on the Prewalk path and then `enforce` as the default follows the Slice 8 benchmark and soak gates. The transaction protocol below remains the enforce-mode mechanism.

## Transaction protocol

Use all steps in one `fabric_exec` invocation. Certificates are bound to its `parentToolCallId` and cannot be transferred to a later call.

1. `schema.hypothesize` stores a nonempty typed evidence set with a label and summary. It binds the durable hypothesis to the current state head/version, workspace fingerprint, workspace generation, and invocation.
2. `schema.verify` checks that all bindings are still current, evaluates every evidence item, and fingerprints before and after evidence. Missing, empty, nonconfirmed, errored, timed-out, cancelled, or workspace-changing evidence fails closed. Only a fully confirmed run issues a cryptographically random, TTL-bounded certificate.
3. `schema.commit` requires both Fabric write and execute approval. It compare-and-swap consumes the certificate exactly once, checks all bindings again, captures durable before images, applies bounded declared operations sequentially, and requires a nonempty typed postcondition set. Any failed operation, undeclared drift, or failed postcondition restores all declared paths. A failed rollback is recorded as `quarantined`; a successful rollback is `rolled_back`.
4. `schema.abort` closes an uncommitted hypothesis and optionally its certificate. Fabric also abandons active artifacts when their `fabric_exec` invocation ends.

Known Schema actions use the typed first-class proxy; reserve `tools.call()` for refs computed at runtime:

```ts
const hypothesis = await schema.hypothesize({
  label: "update-parser",
  summary: "The parser accepts the new local form without changing existing cases",
  evidence: [
    { kind: "file_sha256", path: "src/parser.ts", sha256: "sha256:<64 hex>" },
    { kind: "trusted_command", name: "focused-tests" }
  ]
});

const verification = await schema.verify({
  hypothesisId: hypothesis.hypothesisId
});
const { certificate: _certificate, ...safeVerification } = verification;
if (!verification.verified || !verification.certificate) {
  if (verification.certificate) {
    await schema.abort({
      hypothesisId: hypothesis.hypothesisId,
      certificate: verification.certificate
    });
  }
  return { status: "failed", verification: safeVerification };
}
const parserEvidence = verification.results.find(
  (result) => result.evidence.path === "src/parser.ts",
);
if (!parserEvidence?.observedSha256) {
  await schema.abort({
    hypothesisId: hypothesis.hypothesisId,
    certificate: verification.certificate
  });
  return {
    status: "failed",
    reason: "missing observed SHA-256",
    verification: safeVerification
  };
}

const commit = await schema.commit({
  hypothesisId: hypothesis.hypothesisId,
  certificate: verification.certificate,
  operations: [{
    kind: "edit",
    path: "src/parser.ts",
    oldText: "old literal",
    newText: "new literal",
    expectedSha256: parserEvidence.observedSha256
  }],
  postconditions: [
    { kind: "file_contains", path: "src/parser.ts", literal: "new literal" },
    { kind: "trusted_command", name: "focused-tests" }
  ]
});
return { status: commit.outcome === "committed" ? "success" : "failed", commit };
```

## Evidence and preconditions

Evidence is data, not model-provided shell. Confirmed evidence about an existing file returns its verification-time `observedSha256`, which can be used as the commit precondition without enabling a shell:

- `file_exists: { path }`;
- `file_absent: { path }`;
- `file_contains: { path, literal }`, using literal containment;
- `file_sha256: { path, sha256 }`;
- `trusted_command: { name }`, selecting a host-configured command without model arguments.

No command text, source text, or prose is classified with a regex policy. SHA-256 syntax and provider/config identifiers receive ordinary structural validation only.

Trusted commands are part of the trusted computing base. With `shell: false` (the default), Fabric calls the configured executable with the configured static argv directly, without shell interpretation. With `shell: true`, `command` is the complete trusted shell program and `args` is normalized to an empty array; this avoids pretending shell argv can be escaped portably. Both forms are trusted configuration, never model input. Configure verification commands to be local, deterministic, and read-only. Fabric detects workspace changes after a command, but it cannot prevent a misconfigured trusted command from producing transient or non-workspace side effects.

Commit operations are exact and local:

- `write` requires `expected: { absent: true }` or `expected: { sha256 }`;
- `edit` requires `expectedSha256`, and `oldText` must occur exactly once;
- `delete` requires `expectedSha256`.

Paths must be project-relative regular-file paths. Absolute paths, `..` escape, symbolic links in any component, non-file targets, and missing parent directories are rejected. A transaction does not create directories. Before-image bytes plus write/edit payload bytes must fit `maxBytes`; distinct declared paths must fit `maxFiles`.

A hypothesis can mark `complexityReduction: true`. The committed outcome reports `complexityReductionCertified: true` only after its nonempty postconditions all pass. This certifies only those stated postconditions; it is not a proof of semantic equivalence or an objective complexity measurement.

## Workspace binding and durability

In Git worktrees, the deterministic fingerprint covers:

- exact `HEAD` identity (or an unborn head);
- the NUL-delimited index stage listing;
- path and content/type hashes for every tracked worktree path;
- path and content/type hashes for untracked, non-ignored paths.

Git is invoked with machine-oriented output (`-z` where paths are present); human `git status` prose is never parsed. The session `cwd` must be the worktree root. Unsupported tracked non-file entries (for example, a submodule directory) fail the snapshot rather than silently weakening it. Outside Git, Fabric recursively hashes eligible project files with conservative file/byte bounds and skips dependency/build/cache directories. Host mesh and transaction-journal storage is excluded from the protected snapshot so recording a hypothesis does not invalidate itself.

Hypotheses, certificates, gate reports, and outcomes are durable mesh records/events under `schema/*` and topic `fabric.schema`. A workspace generation compare-and-swap serializes successful outcomes in addition to a cross-process commit lock. Before images are written with owner-only permissions under the mesh transaction journal before mutation. On initialization, an `applying` journal whose owner process is gone is restored; an unreadable or unrestorable journal remains available for operator quarantine. Certificates are CAS-consumed before the first file operation, so a crash cannot make one reusable.

A clean commit advances the Schema generation and best-effort appends a normal state outcome transition. State-transition contention does not falsify the already durable Schema workspace outcome.

## Exact guarantee and limitations

Subject to the host process, filesystem, trusted Fabric configuration, configured trusted commands, and Pi's canonical tool lifecycle/provenance behaving as trusted components, enforce mode guarantees that **model-originated mutation of regular files under the initialized local workspace can be authorized only by this extension's source-provenanced top-level `fabric_exec` and one same-invocation, fresh-certificate `schema.commit` path**, with explicit preconditions, declared paths, bounded captured before images, nonempty typed postconditions, single-use CAS consumption, and rollback reporting.

The guarantee is deliberately narrower than “all effects are transactional”:

- it does not cover remote services, network calls, databases, device files, other processes, or writes performed outside Fabric; enforce mode blocks model access to those provider channels rather than pretending to roll them back;
- it does not provide a kernel sandbox against a malicious extension, SDK host, or host process; trusted host code can invoke effects without model tool calls or falsify lifecycle/provenance data;
- nested-call admission relies on Pi delivering Fabric's reserved generated id prefix unchanged and on Fabric tracking an active owned outer invocation; arbitrary top-level ids with that prefix are still sent through the gate when no owned outer call is active;
- trusted commands are an explicit TCB and can have effects if configured unsafely;
- filesystem rollback cannot be perfectly atomic across process death or hostile concurrent writers; journals recover declared regular files and quarantine failures;
- file postconditions and tests are scoped evidence, not proof;
- host metadata under the configured mesh root is intentionally outside the protected fingerprint.
