In the default QuickJS runtime, guest code has no `process`, `require`, filesystem, network, or subprocess globals. All effects cross the host bridge, where schemas, approvals, audit records, timeouts, and cancellation apply. Each execution receives a fresh QuickJS context. Named strings passed in the `strings` tool parameter are available as `π.key`; accessing a key that was not provided throws a clear, actionable error listing the provided keys rather than silently returning `undefined`.

The optional `node-process` executor runs the same type-checked guest API and host-call protocol in a fresh child process with a configurable V8 heap. It exists for workloads that exceed WASM32's memory ceiling. It is not a security boundary: Node's `vm` module cannot safely contain hostile code, so this mode is restricted to trusted configuration, described as unsafe in `/fabric settings`, and disabled by Schema enforce mode. Parent-side deadlines and cancellation terminate the entire child process.

## Tool discovery and generic calls

Inside `fabric_exec`, the `tools` surface discovers and calls any provider generically — useful when you don't know the exact ref ahead of time:

```ts
const providers = await tools.providers();
const candidates = await tools.search({ query: "GitHub issues" });
const schema = await tools.describe({ ref: candidates[0].ref });
const result = await tools.call({
  ref: schema.ref,
  args: { query: "is:open label:bug" },
});
return result;
```

Known actions have first-class proxies and still cross the same registry path: `mcp.<sanitized_server>.<sanitized_tool>(args)`, `memory.*`, `state.*`, `schema.*`, and `compact.*`. For example, `mcp.fal_ai.get_model_schema(args)` resolves the mcporter names `fal-ai` and `get-model-schema`. Captured extension tools use `extensions.<tool>(args)` in full code mode. Keep `tools.call()` for refs discovered or computed at runtime.

Refs are namespaced: `pi.grep`, `extensions.<tool>`, `mcp.<server>.<tool>`, `schema.<action>`; bare names are rejected. `tools.providers()` → `[{name,description}]`; `tools.catalog({provider?,limit?})` → the deterministic current provider/action head tree with descriptor hashes and explicit non-historical metadata; `tools.search({query,limit?})` → `FabricAction[]`; `tools.describe({ref})` → the full `FabricAction` (read its `inputSchema` first); `tools.call({ref,args?})`; `tools.list({provider?,namespace?,query?,limit?})`; `tools.models()` → Pi `[{provider,id,name,key}]`; `agents.models({runner:"claude"})` → Claude Code runtime models. The model-facing `fabric-exec` skill holds the exact signatures and the read → describe → retry error loop.

## Tool-call robustness

The model-facing `fabric_exec` schema is intentionally flat — one large `code` string plus scalar/optional parameters — with no nested arrays-of-objects containing escaped content. Newer SOTA models are post-trained on one dominant harness's flat tool shapes and can invent trailing keys at the highest-entropy point of a nested escaped-JSON field (e.g. right after closing a long multiline string), which a strict schema rejects. The only nested field, `display`, ignores unknown keys: extras are accepted by the schema and filtered to `{ name, description }` before execution, mirroring the silent-filter behavior the dominant harness's client is trained against.

Fabric's architecture is itself a mitigation for this class of bug. The model authors TypeScript that calls tools, so it never has to faithfully emit an alternative tool schema under sampling pressure; nested object construction happens in deterministic, type-checked code. The residual failure mode is incorrect TypeScript, caught by Fabric's TypeScript checker with an actionable, line-numbered error — the validate/report/retry loop at the code level rather than the JSON-schema level.

For sessions that also call pi tools directly (`read`/`write`/`edit`/`grep`/`find`/`ls`/`bash`), install [pi-tool-repair](https://github.com/monotykamary/pi-tool-repair) as a companion. It validates-then-repairs the finite set of tool-call mistakes those direct calls make — invented keys, wrong field names, stringified arrays, anchor bleed, and leaked tool-call grammars — before tools execute. It hooks `before_provider_request`/`message_end`/`tool_call`; fabric registers a tool, so the two do not conflict.

An external lever outside fabric's control is enabling Anthropic strict tool use at the provider, which prevents the server from sampling keys not in the schema. It is the strongest mitigation for schema drift but trades against Anthropic's complexity limits on strict tool definitions.

## Model-context economy

Final `fabric_exec` output is capped at 50,000 characters by default, matching Pi's built-in 50KB tool ceiling. Failed executions use a tighter 20,000-character visible ceiling while retaining the complete output in the same private artifact. Oversized structured returns share that budget across every multiline section and preserve both ends with explicit omission markers; unstructured output keeps its global beginning and end. Fabric writes the complete output to a mode-`0600` temporary artifact and includes its path inside the visible ceiling, so the model can retrieve a targeted range without carrying the entire result. Type-check diagnostics use the same ceiling. Models should still filter noisy commands and return only useful evidence because source-side projection preserves more relevant information than post-format truncation. If a later nested call fails after earlier calls completed, the error adds a bounded list of completed refs and paths so the model can inspect before repeating side effects; it never exposes nested outputs the guest did not return.

## Federated participant topology

Fabric separates **identity** from **execution ownership**. Roots, one-shot/recursive agents, and actors have one intrinsic participant record with `rootId`, optional `parentId`, `ownerHostId`, and the owner's authenticated wire identity. Main and Peer are projections of root records. Each process publishes one leased host record and only directly managed participants; recursively discovered UI descendants are never re-advertised by an ancestor. Readers treat every record behind an expired host as stale, so crash cleanup is host-wide rather than entity-by-entity. Shared summaries contain operational metadata only—agent prompts, results, and errors stay local. Local run/actor managers overlay richer private detail only when the directory marks that participant local.

Cross-process control is target-resolved, not broadcast. The sender resolves a participant, addresses a versioned command to its owner host, and accepts an acknowledgement only when its target and sender identity match that owner. Owners replay the bounded retained log at startup, CAS-claim command IDs in reserved state, persist acceptance before acknowledging, and re-ack rather than re-execute after restart. A crash after claim but before durable acceptance returns an explicit indeterminate rejection on replay, preserving at-most-once execution. The owner re-resolves against local managers before accepting. Unknown, stale, rejected, spoofed, replayed, or timed-out commands fail closed. Control topics and topology/legacy state prefixes are reserved from guest mesh writes. The old `fabric.steer` event relay plus dual-written root/actor presence remain a mixed-version compatibility path. Absolute project and mesh roots are inherited by Pi children, including worktree and recursive launches, so descendants join the same topology.

## Security and limitations

- Pi Fabric invokes separately constructed Pi built-in definitions when no captured override exists. When Pi's extension runner is available, Fabric replays their native `tool_call`, `tool_result`, and `tool_execution_*` lifecycle; captured overrides and extension tools use the same lifecycle. Fabric's approval and audit layer remains authoritative around every nested call.
- Non-Pi provider results emit a transient namespaced `tool_result` proxy before the QuickJS result bound. Its details envelope exposes the exact host-side result to trusted user extensions, so those extensions can inspect or externalize sensitive provider data; it does not create a separate persisted tool-result message.
- Captured tools execute with the full privileges of their owning extension. Hiding a tool schema is context optimization, not sandboxing. Captured tools retain their definitions and native renderers, but nested calls render as part of the enclosing Fabric execution rather than as separate native tool rows.
- Registry interception composes through the public `ExtensionRunner.getAllRegisteredTools()` method. An extension that replaces that method without delegating to the previous implementation can prevent capture.
- MCP servers and external providers execute with their own host privileges. Review their configuration and code.
- Type checking improves reliability but is not a security boundary. In the default runtime, QuickJS isolation and the host capability bridge are the boundaries. The optional Node process deliberately gives up the QuickJS boundary and must be treated as trusted native execution.
- Child Pi processes load normal extensions by default so provider-backed models continue to work. Claude children use the official installed CLI and its existing authentication. Both runners restrict the active model-facing tools to `defaultTools`; Pi adds `fabric_exec` only for explicit recursion, while Claude rejects recursion and unmapped tools.
- `consult.run` launches host-bounded fresh Pi workers with only read/grep/find/ls, no discovered extensions, and no recursive Fabric. One explicit host extension realpath-checks every tool path against the project and perspective scope before execution; this is a tool-capability boundary, not an OS sandbox. Allowed project content is still sent to the configured model provider. A second host check validates returned file/line addresses under per-file and cumulative byte ceilings. Address validation proves location, not semantic truth; Main must still weigh the finding.
- `agents.handoff` schedules an explicit `agent`-risk delegation at the complete outer `fabric_exec` boundary. The guest call returns a deferred marker and the rest of the Fabric program continues. After all nested calls and outer result middleware finish, Fabric forks through the native assistant `fabric_exec` entry, appends its exact finalized native `toolResult`, and starts the target from that branch. No synthetic nested assistant turns or custom context dump are created. The mode-`0600` child session lives inside the managed run directory, while the source session is neither switched nor historically rewritten. Normal outer output/trace limits apply before the fork. The target model can see the Fabric source and result; do not hand off a trajectory containing secrets to a provider that should not receive them.
- `/fabric prewalk` pre-authorizes the same one-shot delegation using `prewalk.model` or an interactively selected Pi executor. It is a prompt-free adaptation of [Stencil's Prewalk](https://stencil.so/blog/prewalk) and [oh-my-pi's in-place implementation](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/session/agent-session.ts), but its atomic boundary is intentionally coarser: the first monitored mutation marks the outer Fabric invocation, every remaining nested call still runs, and the executor starts only from the complete native `fabric_exec` call/result pair.
- Claude `extensions: true` preserves the user's normal Claude Code customizations, including applicable settings and hooks; those hooks execute with their usual host privileges. Use `extensions: false` for Claude safe mode. `Bash` remains unrestricted inside the child when allowed, just as Fabric's `bash` capability is.
- Claude model discovery uses a local initialization control request and does not invoke a model. Actual one-shot and actor activations use the account/API billing already configured in Claude Code; Fabric records the CLI's reported `total_cost_usd` in normal usage and budget ledgers.
- A Git worktree isolates files, not credentials, network access, processes, or external services.
- Agent transcripts are projected from local `events.jsonl` run logs. The dashboard redacts common credentials from compact tool previews, but the permission-restricted raw event log can contain assistant text, tool arguments/results, diagnostics, and extension protocol payloads. Persisted `fabric_exec` traces also retain projected bash command text for command previews; treat retained session and run data as sensitive.
- Background one-shot children are stopped when the parent Pi session shuts down. A detached `agents.spawn()` sends a follow-up completion message unless the caller later waits for it or `notifyOnComplete` is disabled. Durable participant lifecycle subscriptions provide source-qualified Pi/run notifications across roots, agents, and actors without transcript disclosure; their mesh cursors prevent historical replay and survive owner restarts. Completed worktrees are intentionally retained.
- Persistent actors are suspended on shutdown and restored when project trust is active. Claude actor session IDs refer to Claude Code's own persisted session store; removing that private session makes resume fail, and removing a Fabric actor does not currently delete Claude Code's private transcript. By default (`mesh.actorScope: "project"`), their definitions, mailbox history, and child session files live under `.pi/fabric/mesh/actors/` and are shared across all Pi sessions in the project, so actors survive `/new`. Set `mesh.actorScope: "session"` to isolate actors per Pi session instead. Mesh topics and shared state are always project-scoped. Do not place secrets in actor prompts, messages, or mesh state.
- Approving `agents.create()` delegates future subscribed events to that actor until it is stopped. Each activation uses the actor's fixed runner and persisted tool allowlist/model setting; review them before approving a persistent actor. Tool changes apply only to later activations.
- Actor responses can enter the main context only through the delivery policy fixed at creation. Directive output is schema-validated, but it is still untrusted model output that the main agent should weigh.
- Project-scoped actor execution is ownership-gated: passive sessions do not consume events, run mailboxes, expose private actor data, mutate settings, or persist shutdown state, and they reload the registry after acquiring ownership. Shared `actors.json` updates use a stale-safe lock plus ownership-aware read/merge/write, so one actor owner cannot overwrite another owner's newer records. Use session scope when roots should define fully independent actor sets. Mesh events are append-only until bounded log compaction retains the newest tail; archive or remove an old mesh root when even that retained history is no longer useful.
