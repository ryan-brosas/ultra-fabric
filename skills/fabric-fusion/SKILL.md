# Fabric Fusion

Use one `fabric_exec` call for a 2–8 model panel and a judge when at least two responses complete. The judge compares rather than merges responses; return a compact status/coverage/analysis envelope so the caller writes the final answer. Use fusion for model-diverse research or critique, not tactical work or a lookup.

Pass every key: `strings.task`; JSON `strings.panel` as `Array<{ model, label? }>`; and optional `strings.judge`, `strings.tools`, and `strings.thinking` as empty strings when unset. Labels are attribution only. Tools default to `read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, and `bash`; thinking defaults to configured agent thinking.

```ts
type FusionAnalysis = {
  consensus: string[];
  contradictions: string[];
  partial_coverage: string[];
  unique_insights: string[];
  blind_spots: string[];
};

const task = π.task;
const panel = JSON.parse(π.panel) as Array<{ model: string; label?: string }>;
if (panel.length < 2 || panel.length > 8) {
  throw new Error("Fusion panel (analysis_models) must have 2–8 members.");
}
const toolset = π.tools ? (JSON.parse(π.tools) as string[]) : ["read", "grep", "find", "ls", "bash"];
const thinking = π.thinking ? (π.thinking as FabricThinking) : undefined;

Choose distinct models by intent: strongest available, budget-balanced with a frontier judge, or similar-latency models for faster fan-out. The default panel size is three. Cost is N panel calls plus a judge when comparison is possible. Reserve `panel.length + 1` top-level agent calls. Concurrent calls can overshoot observational token/USD checks because usage settles afterward; those settings are not hard concurrent reservations.

Panel members and the judge are plain, non-recursive agents, so deliberation is one level. `bash` enables web access through local search/fetch commands and requires execute approval. Concurrency is capped by `agents.maxConcurrent`; inner calls otherwise inherit provider limits and use `thinking` for reasoning effort.

For same-model role diversity, recommend `/skill:fabric-council` for the user to invoke; do not invoke another user-only skill yourself. Use a plain agent when competing model perspectives do not justify the cost.

## Completion criterion

Return `success`, `partial`, or `failed` with explicit panel coverage. Successful judging returns only the structured comparison; raw responses return only when judging fails or fewer than two models complete. A partial result is usable and must not trigger an automatic full-panel rerun. Failures retain label and canonical model key; retry only failed models or the judge when that missing coverage matters.
